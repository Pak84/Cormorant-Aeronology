	//BLOCK II PARTS	
		//CERV
		#LOC_CA_CERVcp = CA - Mk3 Block II CERV Cockpit
			#LOC_CA_CERVcp_desc = The Crew Escape and Return Vehicle (CERV) is a major advancement in crew safety for the shuttle program. Along with the ST-6 engines, CERV Wings, and CERV decoupler the entire crew compartment is capable of escaping a critical launch failure and returning to the launch site.
			In addition to crew safety the spacious flight deck seats 6 passengers and 2 flight crew. 
			
		#LOC_CA_LES = CA - Mk3 Shuttle CERV Decoupler
			#LOC_CA_LES_desc = Mounts the CERV cockpit to the standard Mk3 Shuttle Bay. Includes decoupler, MonoPropellant, and reaction wheels.
			
		#LOC_CA_CERVwing = CA - Mk3 Shuttle CERV Wing
			#LOC_CA_CERVwing_desc = Small delta wing for the Mk3 CERV. A critical component for not crashing. Press the "Flip Yaw" button on the mirrored wing to not look silly.

		#LOC_CA_B2skid = CA - Mk3 Block II Landing Skid	
			#LOC_CA_B2skid_desc = A simple and lightweight solution to landing that isn't designed for comfort and definitely doesn't offer any. Currently very difficult to land on. 
	
		//Wings
		#LOC_CA_delta = CA - Mk3 Shuttle Delta Wing
			#LOC_CA_delta_desc = Larger Big-S Delta wing with flat tips for mounting rudders
	
		#LOC_CA_B2rudder = CA - Mk3 Block II Rudder	
			#LOC_CA_B2rudder_desc = Rudder intended for the wingtips of the Mk3 Block II Delta wings. Replaces the tradition shuttle rudder offering better control at high angles of attack and clearance for the CERV cockpit during launch abort.
		
		//Engines
		#LOC_CA_title_STBE = CA - STB-26 Liquid Booster Engine
			#LOC_CA_desc_STBE = The Space Transit Booster (STB) further compromises efficiency to reduce costs when used with the Mk3 Block II program's liquid fuel boosters. 	
			
		#LOC_CA_title_STles = CA - ST-6 "Tiny Tim" Liquid Engine
			#LOC_CA_desc_STBE = Designed as a Launch Escape engine for the Mk3 Block II cockpit but is also a useful small engine for other applications.

		
		//LRB parts
		#LOC_CA_title_LRBmid = CA - LRB-7 Fuel Tank
			#LOC_CA_desc_LRBmid = 3.125m mid size tank designed to serve as a safer and more capable replacement to the Shuttle's SRB-4
			
		#LOC_CA_title_LRBlong = CA - LRB-14 Fuel Tank
			#LOC_CA_desc_LRBlong =	3.125m main tank designed to serve as a safer and more capable replacement to the Shuttle's SRB-4
			
		#LOC_CA_title_LRBengine = CA - LRB Engine Mount
			#LOC_CA_desc_LRBengine = 3.125m Quad engine mount with ablative protection for re-entry
			
		#LOC_CA_title_LRBnose = CA - LRB Separation Nosecone
			#LOC_CA_desc_LRBnose = 	3.125m nosecone with separation boosters.
	
		#LOC_CA_title_AdapM = CA - LRB Multi-Adapter
			#LOC_CA_desc_AdapM = A structural adapter from 3.125m to 1.25m, 1.875m, 2.5m, or 3.75m with built in top decoupler. Also functions as an interstage.
			#LOC_CA_switcher_AdapM = Adapter Size
			
		#LOC_CA_title_Adap5 = CA - LRB 5m Adapter
			#LOC_CA_desc_Adap5 = A structural adapter from 3.125m to 5m with built in top decoupler. Also functions as an interstage.
			
		//Booster Separation
		#LOC_CA_title_LRBdec = CA - Liquid Booster Decoupler
			#LOC_CA_desc_LRBdec = Designed to hold 3.125m Boosters to the Shuttle External Tank
		
		#LOC_CA_title_heavySep = CA - Liquid Fuel Heavy Separator Pack
			#LOC_CA_desc_heavySep = LFO powered separator motors for heavy stages. Has a small prime of fuel to get the engines started, but is best used while there's still some fuel in the tanks being separated. Despite being LFO, these engines are not throttleable.
