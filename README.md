# Cormorant-Aeronology
v1.5.1 Update

Changes: 
- New SRB-4 thrust curves - Performance is similar on the shuttle but they should be more predicatable for other types of lifters
- Fixed collider issue on custom name plates

Added: 
- Heavy Payload Mount and Payload Bay Decoupler - Set of decouplers to mount large satellites or other payloads securely into the cargo bay. The Payload Bay Decoupler also acts as a strut.

- Shuttle Payload Technologies by @MrMeeb - A stock version of SPT has been added into Cormorant. This includes 2 Payload bay options and a full set of Skylab parts for all your science needs.
